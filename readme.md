## üéØ Introduction

Zig is a modern systems programming language designed for robustness, optimal performance, and simplicity. This repository is my personal sandbox to:

- Learn Zig syntax and features.
- Practice problem-solving using Zig.
- Experiment with different programming techniques and tools.

---

## ü§î Why This Repository

This repository is primarily for my learning and self-improvement. By sharing my progress publicly, I hope to:

- Document my journey in a structured way.
- Receive constructive feedback from the community.
- Help others who might be starting their own journey in Zig.

---

## üìö Resources

I will be using various online resources, official documentation, and the [Zig Learn](https://ziglearn.org/) site as primary references for understanding Zig concepts and exercises. Additional practice comes from [Ziglings](https://github.com/ratfactor/ziglings), a collection of small exercises for learning Zig.

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

To follow along or try out the programs, you'll need:

- Zig compiler installed ([official website](https://ziglang.org/download/)).
- A text editor or IDE of your choice (e.g., Vim, Visual Studio Code, etc.).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gurjaka/Zig-Programming-Language.git
cd Zig-Programming-Language
````

### Compile and Run a Program

Navigate to the directory containing the program you want to run and compile it using:

```bash
zig build-exe program_name.zig
./program_name
```

For example:

```bash
zig build-exe zig-learn/hello_world.zig
./hello_world
```
