## üìñ Quick Reference

### Essential Concepts (in order of learning)
1. **Basic syntax** (variables, functions, types)
2. **Error handling** (`!` and `try`)
3. **Memory management** (allocators, defer)
4. **Structs and enums**
5. **Optionals** (`?T`)
6. **Comptime basics**
7. **Testing** (built-in test framework)
8. **Build system** (`build.zig`)
9. **C interop** (`@import("c")`)
10. **Advanced comptime** (generics, reflection)

### Common Gotchas for C Developers
- No implicit conversions (use explicit casts)
- Arrays have compile-time known size
- Slices (`[]T`) vs arrays (`[N]T`)
- `undefined` is not zero (use explicit initialization)
- No function overloading (use generics instead)

### Performance Tips
- Prefer stack allocation when possible
- Use `comptime` to move work to compile time
- Profile before optimizing (use `zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseFast`)
- Understand different optimization modes
